<h2>Design Patterns Overview</h2>

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to various design patterns in software development. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems, encapsulating best practices to improve code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility. This README will focus on explaining five important design patterns: Singleton, Strategy, Command, Adapter, Factory, Decorator, Abstract Factory, and Composite.

Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
